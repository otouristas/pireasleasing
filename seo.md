🧩 Internal Linking Strategy (Core Logic)

Main Nav: Home → Piraeus → Airport → Monthly Leasing → FAQ → Contact
Footer Links: “Rent a Car in Athens” (→ /athens-airport-car-rental), “Rent a Car in Piraeus”, “Monthly Leasing”
In-Content CTAs:

“Traveling by ferry? → Rent at Piraeus Port”

“Arriving by plane? → Airport rentals 24/7”

“Need a car long-term? → See our monthly leasing offers”

Each location page links laterally to others (Airport ↔ Piraeus ↔ Monthly Leasing) + all link back to Home and Contact.
